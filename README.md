# MIO_CV
New project to build a CV with Laravel

This is still an ongoing project. 
I hope it'll help people in building their own cv once I finish it.

My actual problem for now is that:
Even if it works for one user, it doesn't work if there are multiple people wanting to create their own CV through it as I still have some difficulties with manipulating the database.

I'm already looking for a way to solve that but if anyone has any suggestions it will be welcomed.
