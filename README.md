This is my first personal project with laravel. It consists in creating a CV by just filling the forms and not filling them if you think it's not necessary.

This project of mine is still on-going, so I'm still correcting every default step by step while leaning new things.

My actual problem for now is that:
Even if it works for one user, it doesn't work if there are multiple people wanting to create their own CV through it as I still have some difficulties with manipulating the database.

I'm already looking for a way to solve that but if anyone has any suggestions it will be welcomed.
